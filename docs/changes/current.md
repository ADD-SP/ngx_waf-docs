### Fixed


***

## [10.1.2] - 2022-07-09 UTC+0800

### Fixed

* compatible with `nginx-1.23.0`

***

## [10.1.1] - 2022-01-07 UTC+0800

### Added

* PCRE2 library support. 

### Fixed

* Memory leak.

* CAPTCHA and Under-Attack-Mode sometimes cause infinite page refreshes.


***

## [10.1.0] - 2021-12-14 UTC+0800

### Added

* You can set the directive `waf` to ` bypass`, in which case no requests will be intercepted, but ngx_waf will still do the detection and logging.

* The directive `waf_verify_bot` has a new parameter `SogouSpider`, which is used to verify if it is a Sogou crawler.


### Fixed

* Garbage collection is not running, which does not lead to memory leaks, but does lead to performance problems.

* Sometimes the `[FAKE-BOT]` log is printed incorrectly.

***

## [10.0.1] - 2021-12-05 UTC+0800

### Added

* Added two Easter eggs, which you can find clues in the documentation. These two eggs are not triggered automatically and need to be enabled manually.

### Fixed

* All parameters of the directive `waf_mode` corresponding to the request method are not working.


***

## [10.0.0] - 2021-11-30 UTC+0800

### Added

* New directive `waf_zone`, used to declare a piece of shared memory that will be used for other directives, such as `waf_cc_deny`.

* New directive `waf_action`, used to set actions after intercepting a request, such as returning a specific status code or challenging the client with a captcha.

* New directive `waf_block_page`, used to set the blocking page to return the specified HTML file when the request is blocked.

* A new embedded variable, `$waf_rate`, is used to indicate the number of accesses to the current IP in a period. The period is determined by the parameter `rate` of the directive `waf_cc_deny`, or by the parameter `duration` if the IP has been blacked out.

* The directive `waf_captcha` has a new parameter `max_fails`, which sets the maximum number of attempts for the captcha and the blocking time after it is exceeded.

* The directive `waf_captcha` has a new parameter `zone` that specifies a piece of shared memory, which needs to be set if and only if the parameter `max_fails` is set.

* The directive `waf_captcha` has a new parameter `sitekey`, which needs to be set if and only if the parameter `file` is omitted.

* When you reload nginx, the module keeps as much information in shared memory as possible so that it is not emptied, such as statistics used by CC protection.


### Removed

* The directive `waf_http_status` has been removed and the related features have been merged into the directive `waf_action`.

* The parameter `size` of the directive `waf_cc_deny` has been removed and `zone` is now used instead.


### Changed

* You can omit the parameter `file` of the directive `waf_under_attack`; omitting this parameter will use a built-in file from `assets/under_attack.html`.

* You can omit the argument `file` to the directive `waf_captcha`, which when omitted will use a built-in file based on the value of the argument `prov`, which comes from the directory `assets/`.

***

### New test suite

By chance, I found a test suite: [test-nginx](https://github.com/openresty/test-nginx).
It looked great, so I wrote a lot of test cases and tested with it. <del>Un</del>fortunately I found a lot of bugs, very wise of me.

***

## [8.0.3] - 2021-08-27 UTC+0800
